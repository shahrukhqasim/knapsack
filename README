This program was written rather quickly to train myself.

It uses a dynamic programming type approach to the 0/1 knapsack problem
(in the bound or unbound form).

Note that the classical dynamic programming approach based on arrays
requires an enormous amount of memory if the weights are huge.
In contrast, this program uses only actually needed memory.

Therefore, this program is appropriate to e.g. calculate an "optimal"
filling for a CD or DVD from a given collection of relatively large files.

The program consists of libraries which can be used independently:

knapsack.h:        The main class consisting of generic templates libraries.
                   The output functions have to be overloaded.
knapsack_output.h: Some instances of the Knapsack classes with output overload

The libraries are consumed by
knapsack.cc:       A simple CLI to some of the instances

Installation:
Just run "make" (as user) and "make install" (as root).
To use the libraries, just include them (with the appropriate path)
To use the zsh completion file, make sure that it is in you zsh's $fpath.

To get help for the CLI, type
knapsack -h
