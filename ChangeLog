# ChangeLog for knapsack

*knapsack-4.0
	Martin V채th <martin at mvath.de>:
	- This is practically a complete rewrite, saving only some concepts:
	- Support multiple knapsacks
	- Support mixing bound and unbound items
	- Handle multiplicity of items without re-entering
	- Possibly fix false results in the bound case (the old function used
	  an output logic which might be too simple in some complex situations)
	- CLI supports now integer values (even by default)
	- Complete rework of EAPI and CLI
	- Depend on boost for hashing
	- Since boost is needed anyway, depend also on boost::format
	- Drop dependency on https://github.com/vaeth/osformat

*knapsack-3.0
	Martin V채th <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Use https://github.com/vaeth/osformat for typesafe output:
	- Turn the classes in knapsack_output.h into generic templates
	  (which is possible using the osformat class)
	- Let the CLI use the highest integer/floating precision which is
	  natively supported by the compiler

*knapsack-2.0
	Martin V채th <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Provide libraries as generic templates
	- Provide zsh completion
	- Provide a tiny testsuite
	- Provide a Makefile
	- Add .gitignore and CPPLINT

*knapsack-1.0
	Martin V채th <martin at mvath.de>:
	- Initial implementation within 1-2 hours
