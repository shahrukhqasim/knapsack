This program was written rather quickly to train myself.

It uses a dynamic programming type approach to the 0/1 knapsack problem
(in the bound or unbound form).

Note that the classical dynamic programming approach based on arrays
requires an enormous amount of memory if the weights are huge.
In contrast, this program uses only actually needed memory.

Therefore, this program is appropriate to e.g. calculate an "optimal"
filling for a CD or DVD from a given collection of relatively large files.
